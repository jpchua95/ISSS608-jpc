The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one\n\n-   `alphaLines`: reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1\n\n-   `boxplot`: turn on the boxplot with `TRUE`. The default value is `FALSE`\n\n-   `title`: provide the parallel coordinates plot a title\n:::\n\n## 2.3 Parallel coordinates with facet\n\nIn the code chunk below, `facet_wrap()` of *ggplot2* is used to plot 10 small miltiple parallel coordinates plots.\n\nEach plot represents 1 geographical region.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05d_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2.4 Rotating x-axis text label\n\nThe x-axis label can be rotated to make it easier to read, using `theme()` function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05d_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n-   `axis.text.x` is used to rotate the x-axis text labels\n\n-   `element_text(angle=30)` is used to rotate the text by an angle of 30 degree\n:::\n\n## 2.5 Adjusting the rotated x-axis text label\n\n`hjust` argument can be used within `element_text()` to adjust the text location so the label does not overlap with the plot.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05d_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# 3.
