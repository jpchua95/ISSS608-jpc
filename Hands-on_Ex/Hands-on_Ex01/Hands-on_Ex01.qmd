## 1. Getting Started

In this exercise, we will read and learn the basic principles and essential components of ggplot2.

First, we load tidyverse into R environment using the code chunk below.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## 2. Importing Data

The code chunk below uses read_csv() of readr to import the Exam_data dataset into R environment.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## 3. Understanding ggplot

ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.

It is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.

## 4. Compare R Graphics with ggplot

::: panel-tabset
### R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS)
```

### ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```
:::

As we can see, both plots are relatively similar and the codes for R Graphics is more straightforward. However, we can customise our plots with ggplot2, which will be more helpful when creating complex, visually appealing and more insightful graphs for visualisation.

## 5. The Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.

From Prof Kam's notes, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. It defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.

There are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:

-   Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements

-   Meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping

A good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.

The figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2: ![](grammar%20of%20graphics.jpg)

A short description of each building block is as follow:

-   **Data**: The dataset being plotted

-   **Aesthetics**: Take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency

-   **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line

-   **Facets**: Split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots)

-   **Statistics**: Statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals)

-   **Coordinate systems**: Define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic

-   **Themes**: Modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background

## 6. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2

When calling ggplot with just the `data` argument, a blank canvas would return as it initialises the ggplot object. This specifies the dataset to be used for the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data)
```

By including the `aes` argument, we include the x-axis and the axis' label.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS))
```

Next, we look at adding geometric objects to the graph. We can create layers using a `geom_` function.

::: callout-note
The full list can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).
:::

### 6.1 Geometric Objects: geom_bar()

The code chunk below plots a bar chart using `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x= RACE)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

### 6.2 Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot()

The code chunk below plots a dot plot using `geom_dotplot()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x= MATHS)) + 
    geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)
```

The code chunk below turns off the y-axis with `scale_y_continuous` and changes the binwidth to 2.5.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         
               dotsize = 0.5) +      
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           
                     breaks = NULL)  
```

### 6.3 Geometric Objects: geom_histogram()

The code chunk below plots a histogram using `geom_histogram()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram()       
```

### 6.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()

Next, we explore the various elements by changing the arguments in `geom`:

-   *bins*: change the number of bins

-   *fill*: shade the histogram

-   *color*: changes the outline color of the bars

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20,            
                 color="black",      
                 fill="light blue")  
```

### 6.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()

Next, we explore the various elements by changing the arguments in `aes`:

-   *fill*: changes the interior colour of the histogram

    -   Here, we need to specify the sub-group

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="grey30")
```

### 6.6 Geometric Objects: geom_density()

`geom-density()` computes and plots [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), which is a smoothed version of the histogram.

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.

The code chunk below plots the distribution of MATHS scores in a kernel density estimate plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_density()  
```

By adding the `colour` or `fill` argument to `aes()`, we plot 2 kernel density lines, which shows the distribution by `GENDER`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, 
           colour = GENDER)) +
  geom_density()
```

### 6.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot()

`geom_boxplot()` displays continuous value list on the plot. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.

The code chunk below plots boxplots using geom_boxplot().

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS,       
           x= GENDER)) +    
  geom_boxplot()    
```

Within `geom_boxplot()`, the `notch` argument helps visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.

::: callout-note
Read more about notches [here](https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home/notched-box-plots).
:::

The code chunk below plots the distribution of MATHS scores by GENDER in notched plot instead of boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

### 6.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin()

`geom_violin` creates violin plot, which compares multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.

The code chunk below plots the distribution of MATHS score by gender in violin plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_violin()
```

### 6.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()

`geom_point()` is especially useful for creating scatterplot.

The code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the MATHS and ENGLISH grades of pupils using `geom_point()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point()  
```

### 6.10 Combining geom Objects

The `geom` objects can be combined to form meaning plots and retrieve meaningful insights.

The code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_point()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +                    
  geom_point(position="jitter", 
             size = 0.5)        
```

## 7. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: stat

The [Statistics functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#stats) statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:

-   frequency of values of a variable (bar graph)

    -   a mean

    -   a confidence limit

-   There are two ways to use these functions:

    -   add a `stat_()` function and override the default geom, or

    -   add a `geom_()` function and override the default stat.

### 7.1 Working with stat()

The code chunk below plots 2 boxplots. However, the plots are incomplete as they do not show the positions of the means, making it difficult to derive a reliable and accurate statistical interpretation.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### 7.2 The stat_summary() method

The code chunk below adds mean values by using the `stat_summary()` function and overriding the default geom.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(geom = "point",       
               fun = "mean",         
               colour ="red",        
               size=4)    
```

### 7.3 The geom() method

The code chunk below adding mean values by using `geom_()` function and overriding the default stat.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat="summary",        
             fun="mean",           
             colour="red",          
             size=4)       
```

### 7.4 Best fit curve on a scatterplot

The code chunk below plots a scatterplot, showing the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. However, it is hard to interpet the graph.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point()
```

`geom_smooth()` can be used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(size=0.5)   
```

::: callout-note
The default method used is *loess*.
:::

The default smoothing method can be overridden with the `method` argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5)
```

## 8. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Facets

Facetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: [facet_grid()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html) and [facet_wrap](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html).

### 8.1 Working with facet_wrap()

The code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_wrap().

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20) +
    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)
```

### 8.2 facet_grid() function

[facet_grid()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html) forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.

The code chunk below plots a trellis plot using `facet_grid()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
    geom_histogram(bins=20) +
    facet_grid(~ CLASS)
```

## 9. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Coordinates

The Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use:

-   [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out)

-   [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped

-   [`coord_fixed()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html): a cartesian system with a "fixed" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a "widescreen" plot)

-   [`coord_quickmap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps

### 9.1 Working with Coordinate

By default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form:

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using `coord_flip()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

### 9.2 Changing the y- and x-axis range

The following scatterplot is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)
```

The code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100, by adding the arguments `xlim` and `ylim` to `coord_cartesian`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))
```

## 10. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: themes

Themes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:

-   background colour

-   size of fonts

-   gridlines

-   colour of labels

Built-in themes include:

-   `theme_gray()` (default)

-   `theme_bw()`

-   `theme_classic()`

::: callout-note
The list of themes can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html).
:::

The code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using `theme_gray()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_gray()
```

A horizontal bar chart plotted using `theme_classic()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```

A horizontal bar chart plotted using `theme_minimal()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 11. Additional Elements

### 11.1 Geometric Objects: geom_jitter

In [6.10 Combining geom Objects](https://jpchua-isss608.netlify.app/hands-on_ex/hands-on_ex01/hands-on_ex01#combining-geom-objects), The jitter geom adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point. Altertively, `geom_jitter()` can also be used.

It is useful in preventing overplotting, which occurs when many points overlap and prevent use from observing the true distribution of the data, especially in smaller datasets.

::: callout-note
Click [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) to read more about `jitter points`.
:::

The code chunk below displays the same plots with a different function.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +                    
  geom_jitter(size = 0.5)
```

### 11.2 Working with facets with modified aes()

The code chunk below added the breakdown by GENDER by colour in each panel. This provides a clear representation of the performance by GENDER in each CLASS.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20) +
    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)
```

### 11.3 Combining facets with geom_violin()

The code chunk below added `facet_wrap()` to the violin plot, which allows us to compare the distributions of MATHS of each class by GENDER.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= GENDER, y = MATHS)) +
    geom_violin()+
    stat_summary(geom = "point",       
               fun = "mean",         
               colour ="red",        
               size=1)   +
    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)
```
